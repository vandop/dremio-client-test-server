# JDBC Compatibility Analysis - macOS ARM64

## Issue Summary

The JDBC driver integration using JPype and JayDeBeApi is experiencing fatal JVM crashes on macOS ARM64 systems. This document analyzes the issue and provides alternative solutions.

## Problem Details

### Error Signature
```
SIGBUS (0xa) at pc=0x00000001202f3540
Problematic frame: V [libjvm.dylib+0x2f3540] CodeHeap::allocate(unsigned long)+0x1d4
```

### Environment
- **OS**: macOS 15.5 (24F74) on Apple Silicon (ARM64)
- **Java Versions Tested**: OpenJDK 11.0.23, OpenJDK 17.0.11, OpenJDK 21.0.5
- **JPype Version**: 1.5.2 → 1.6.0 (upgraded, issue persists)
- **JayDeBeApi Version**: 1.2.3
- **Architecture**: arm64 (Apple Silicon)

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **JVM Initialization Failure**: The crash occurs during JVM startup in the CodeHeap allocator
2. **Architecture Compatibility**: Issue appears specific to macOS ARM64 + JPype combination
3. **Memory Management**: The error is in the JVM's code heap allocation system
4. **Consistent Failure**: Occurs across multiple Java versions and JPype configurations

## Attempted Solutions

### ✅ Tested Successfully
- Java environment verification
- JDBC driver availability (45.9 MB Dremio driver present)
- Python dependencies (JayDeBeApi, JPype)

### ❌ Failed Attempts
1. **Conservative JVM Settings**:
   ```python
   jpype.startJVM(
       jvm_path,
       "-Xmx256m", "-Xms64m",
       "-XX:+UseSerialGC",
       "-Djava.awt.headless=true"
   )
   ```

2. **Multiple Java Versions**:
   - Java 11 (ARM64): SIGBUS crash
   - Java 17 (ARM64): SIGBUS crash  
   - Java 21 (ARM64): SIGBUS crash

3. **JPype Upgrade**: 1.5.2 → 1.6.0 (no improvement)

4. **Alternative JVM Paths**: Direct libjvm.dylib specification

## Current Status

**JDBC Driver**: ❌ **DISABLED** due to JVM compatibility issues

```python
def _check_jdbc(self) -> bool:
    """Check if JDBC (JayDeBeApi) is available."""
    # JDBC driver temporarily disabled due to JVM crashes on macOS ARM64
    logger.warning("JDBC driver disabled due to JVM compatibility issues on macOS ARM64")
    return False
```

## Alternative Solutions

### 1. ✅ PyArrow Flight SQL (Recommended)
- **Status**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Performance**: Excellent (native Arrow format)
- **Compatibility**: Full Dremio Cloud support
- **Features**: All query types, authentication, SSL

### 2. ✅ ADBC Flight SQL
- **Status**: ⚠️ Schema validation issues (known limitation)
- **Performance**: Good when working
- **Compatibility**: Limited due to strict schema validation

### 3. ✅ PyODBC (If configured)
- **Status**: Available but requires ODBC driver setup
- **Performance**: Good
- **Compatibility**: Requires additional configuration

## Recommendations

### For Development
1. **Primary**: Use **PyArrow Flight SQL** - provides excellent performance and full compatibility
2. **Secondary**: Configure PyODBC if ODBC connectivity is needed
3. **Avoid**: JDBC until JPype/macOS ARM64 compatibility is resolved

### For Production
1. **Deploy on Linux x86_64** where JPype/JDBC typically works better
2. **Use PyArrow Flight SQL** as primary driver (recommended anyway)
3. **Container deployment** may resolve architecture-specific issues

## Future Solutions

### Potential Fixes
1. **JPype Updates**: Monitor JPype releases for ARM64 improvements
2. **Alternative JDBC Bridges**: Explore py4j or other Java-Python bridges
3. **Native JDBC**: Use subprocess-based Java execution
4. **Docker Deployment**: Use x86_64 containers with emulation

### Monitoring
- Track JPype GitHub issues for macOS ARM64 fixes
- Test future JPype releases
- Consider alternative Java-Python integration methods

## Technical Details

### JVM Crash Logs
Crash logs consistently show:
- SIGBUS (bus error) during JVM initialization
- CodeHeap allocation failure
- Occurs before any application code runs
- Independent of JVM settings or Java version

### Environment Variables
```bash
JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-11.jdk/Contents/Home
PATH includes Java binaries
DREMIO_CLOUD_URL and DREMIO_PAT configured
```

### Dependencies Status
```
✅ Java 11/17/21 available
✅ JPype1 1.6.0 installed
✅ JayDeBeApi 1.2.3 installed
✅ Dremio JDBC driver (45.9 MB)
❌ JVM startup fails consistently
```

## Conclusion

The JDBC integration is currently incompatible with macOS ARM64 due to fundamental JVM startup issues in the JPype library. The **PyArrow Flight SQL driver provides excellent performance and full compatibility**, making it the recommended solution for Dremio connectivity.

**Recommendation**: Continue using PyArrow Flight SQL as the primary driver and monitor JPype development for future ARM64 compatibility improvements.
