## 🚀 **How to Use the HTML Report**

### 1. **Open the Report**
```bash
# Open in browser
open htmlcov/index.html
# Or navigate to the file in your browser
```

### 2. **Navigate the Interface**
- **Main page**: Overview of all files with coverage percentages
- **Click file names**: Drill down to line-by-line coverage
- **Use filters**: Focus on specific files or coverage levels
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `f/s/m/x/c` to sort columns

### 3. **Identify Improvement Areas**
- **Red lines**: Code not covered by tests
- **Green lines**: Code covered by tests
- **Gray lines**: Excluded from coverage analysis

### 4. **Focus on Critical Files**
Priority order for improving coverage:
1. **app.py** (main application logic)
2. **dremio_hybrid_client.py** (core functionality)
3. **config.py** (configuration management)

## 📈 **Coverage Improvement Strategy**

### **Immediate Wins (Easy to improve)**
1. **Add more app.py tests** - Focus on error paths and edge cases
2. **Test configuration edge cases** - Invalid values, missing variables
3. **Add client integration tests** - Real connection scenarios

### **Medium-term Goals**
1. **Increase app.py coverage to 80%+**
2. **Add end-to-end integration tests**
3. **Test error recovery scenarios**

### **Long-term Vision**
1. **Achieve 70%+ overall coverage**
2. **Add performance regression tests**
3. **Implement browser-based UI testing**

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

### ✅ **Strengths**
- **Excellent test infrastructure** (96-99% coverage)
